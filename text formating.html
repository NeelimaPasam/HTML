   <p><b>Hyderabad</b> District is a <i> city-district</i> in the state of Telangana ,It is the smallest in terms of area, among all the districts in the state, but has the highest human density.Hyderabad district was formed initially in the year 1948 followed by Police Action by merging the Atraf-a-Balda District and Baghat Districts. In the year 1978, Hyderabad district was later split into Hyderabad Urban District and Hyderabad Rural. Currently, Hyderabad Urban district is known as the Hyderabad district.Hyderabad is known as the <strong>City of Pearls</strong>, as it had once flourished as a global center for trade of rare diamonds, emeralds as well as <em>natural pearls</em>.</p>
<p>In 1950 the <small>natural pearls</small>princely state became the state of Hyderabad in the <mark>Indian union</mark> . In 1956 the state was split up: its Telugu-speaking areas (the Telangana region) were combined with what was then <del>Andhra state</del> to form Andhra Pradesh, with Hyderabad as the capital. Discontent grew, however, among the people of <ins>Telangana</ins>, who insisted that the region should become a separate state. Following protracted negotiations—particularly about the disposition of Hyderabad—and after receiving approval for the split from the Indian parliament, Telangana was formed in 2014. It was agreed that Hyderabad would act as capital of both states for a period of up to 10 years to allow <sub>Andhra</sub> <sup>Pradesh</sup>  time to build its own capital.</p>
